## üêõ If It's Not Working

### Check 1: Are cookies being set?
```
1. After verification, open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies
2. Look for customer_auth and customer_email
3. If missing, the API isn't setting cookies properly
```

### Check 2: Check browser console
```
1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Console
2. Look for any errors
3. Check Network tab ‚Üí verify request ‚Üí Response Headers
4. Should see Set-Cookie headers
```

### Check 3: Check server logs
```
Look at the artisan-lux terminal for:
- POST /api/public/verify
- Response status should be 200
```

## üîß Manual Cookie Test

If automatic cookies aren't working, test manually:

1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Console
2. Run:
   ```javascript
   document.cookie = "customer_auth=true; path=/; max-age=604800"
   document.cookie = "customer_email=test@example.com; path=/; max-age=604800"
   ```
3. Refresh page
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/debug-auth
5. Should show authenticated

If this works, the issue is with the API not setting cookies.
