# Resend Verification Code Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Resend Code Button**
Added "Resend code" functionality on all verification screens:
- AuthModal component
- Sign In page (`/signin`)
- Sign Up page (`/signup`)

### 2. **Better UX on Verification Screen**
- **"Didn't receive the code? Resend code"** - Sends a new verification code
- **"Wrong email? Go back"** - Returns to email input screen
- Loading states while resending
- Success/error messages with color coding (green for success, red for errors)

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### Backend (artisan-lux-admin)
**Created:**
- `src/app/api/public/resend-code/route.ts` - API endpoint to resend verification codes

**Modified:**
- `src/lib/verification.ts` - Fixed lazy initialization of Resend client

### Frontend (artisan-lux)
**Created:**
- `src/app/api/public/resend-code/route.ts` - Proxy to admin backend

**Modified:**
- `src/components/site/AuthModal.tsx` - Added resend functionality
- `src/app/(site)/signin/page.tsx` - Added resend functionality
- `src/app/(site)/signup/page.tsx` - Added resend functionality

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **User enters email** → System sends verification code
2. **User on verification screen** → Can:
   - Enter the code to verify
   - Click "Resend code" if they didn't receive it
   - Click "Go back" if they entered wrong email

### Resend Code Flow:
1. User clicks "Resend code"
2. Button shows "Sending..." (disabled)
3. New code generated and sent to email
4. Success message: "New code sent! Check your email." (green)
5. User can enter the new code

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### POST `/api/public/resend-code`
**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "type": "signin" | "signup"
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "message": "New verification code sent to your email"
}
```

**Response (Error):**
```json
{
  "error": "Account not found"
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Before:
- Only "Go back" option if code not received
- No way to resend without going back

### After:
- **"Resend code"** button - instant resend
- **"Go back"** button - if wrong email entered
- Color-coded messages:
  - ✅ Green: "New code sent!", "Verified!"
  - ❌ Red: "Invalid code", "Failed to resend"
- Loading states prevent multiple clicks

## 📧 Resend Account Limitation

**Important:** Your Resend account is in test mode and can only send to:
- **shawnmutogo5@gmail.com** (your Resend account email)

To send to other emails:
1. Verify a domain at https://resend.com/domains
2. Update the `from` email in `verification.ts` to use your domain

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [x] Resend code works on AuthModal
- [x] Resend code works on /signin page
- [x] Resend code works on /signup page
- [x] Loading states display correctly
- [x] Success messages show in green
- [x] Error messages show in red
- [x] Can't spam resend (button disabled while sending)
- [x] Go back button still works
- [x] Backend validates email exists before resending

## 🚀 Next Steps

For production deployment:
1. **Verify your domain** in Resend
2. **Update email sender** in `verification.ts`:
   ```typescript
   from: "Artisan Lux <noreply@yourdomain.com>"
   ```
3. **Test with real users** (not just your Resend email)
4. **Monitor email delivery** in Resend dashboard

## 💡 Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Rate limiting on resend (e.g., max 3 resends per 10 minutes)
- Countdown timer before allowing resend (e.g., "Resend in 30s")
- Email delivery status tracking
- SMS verification as backup option
