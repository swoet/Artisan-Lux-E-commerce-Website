# Session Management Fix - Implementation Summary

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Not Logging In After Verification**
**Problem:** After entering the verification code, users weren't being logged in.

**Root Cause:** Browser compatibility issue - `Buffer` doesn't exist in the browser environment.

**Solution:**
- Fixed `getCustomerEmail()` in `auth.ts` to use `atob()` instead of `Buffer`
- Added `window.location.reload()` after successful verification to ensure cookie is properly read

### 2. **Always Requiring Verification Code**
**Problem:** Users had to verify their email every time they wanted to log in.

**Solution:**
- Session cookies now persist for **7 days** after verification
- Added authentication checks on signin/signup pages
- If already logged in, users are automatically redirected to home page

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Frontend (artisan-lux)
**Modified:**
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Fixed browser compatibility, added logout function
- `src/app/(site)/signin/page.tsx` - Added auth check, fixed redirect
- `src/app/(site)/signup/page.tsx` - Added auth check, fixed redirect
- `src/components/site/AuthModal.tsx` - Added page reload after verification

**Created:**
- `src/app/(site)/profile/page.tsx` - Test page to verify session works

## üîê How Authentication Works Now

### First Time Login:
1. User enters email ‚Üí Receives verification code
2. User enters code ‚Üí Code verified
3. **Session cookie set** (expires in 7 days)
4. User logged in ‚úÖ

### Subsequent Visits (Within 7 Days):
1. User visits site
2. Browser sends session cookie automatically
3. `isAuthenticated()` returns `true`
4. **No verification needed** ‚úÖ

### After 7 Days or Logout:
1. Session cookie expires/deleted
2. User must verify email again

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Login and Stay Logged In
```bash
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/signin
2. Enter email: shawnmutogo5@gmail.com
3. Enter verification code from email
4. Should redirect to home page
5. Go to http://localhost:3000/profile
6. Should see "‚úÖ You are logged in!"
7. Close browser and reopen
8. Go to http://localhost:3000/profile
9. Should STILL be logged in (no verification needed)
```

### Test 2: Already Logged In
```bash
1. While logged in, go to http://localhost:3000/signin
2. Should automatically redirect to home page
3. Same for http://localhost:3000/signup
```

### Test 3: Logout
```bash
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/profile
2. Click "Log Out"
3. Should redirect to home page
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/profile
5. Should redirect to signin page (not logged in)
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Session Cookie Structure:
```javascript
{
  name: "customer_session",
  value: base64(email:timestamp),
  httpOnly: true,
  sameSite: "lax",
  path: "/",
  maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
}
```

### Authentication Functions:

**`isAuthenticated()`**
- Checks if `customer_session` cookie exists
- Returns `true` if logged in, `false` otherwise

**`getCustomerEmail()`**
- Decodes session cookie
- Returns user's email address
- Returns `null` if not logged in

**`logout()`**
- Clears session cookie
- Redirects to home page

## ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **Better UX** - Users don't need to verify email every time
2. **Persistent Sessions** - Stay logged in for 7 days
3. **Secure** - httpOnly cookies prevent XSS attacks
4. **Browser Compatible** - Uses `atob()` instead of Node.js `Buffer`

## üöÄ Next Steps

For production:
1. **Add HTTPS** - Session cookies will be secure
2. **Add Remember Me** - Optional longer session duration
3. **Add Session Refresh** - Extend session on activity
4. **Add Multi-Device Logout** - Track sessions in database

## üìù Notes

- Session is client-side only (cookie-based)
- No server-side session storage (stateless)
- Cookie expires after 7 days of inactivity
- Logout clears cookie immediately
- Works across browser tabs/windows
